# Todo:
* Implement the calculations of [this sheet](https://github.com/javaprogrammingbuw/calculate-and-plot/blob/master/Idea%202.xlsx)
* Plot the resulting graph
* Add test cases to convince me that your calculations are correct (it is sufficient to just test your calculations. You don't need to test the graph)
